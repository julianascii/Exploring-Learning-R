# Exploring-Learning-R

This repository is my personal space for exploring and learning the R programming language. I use it to experiment with various R features, functions, and packages — from data manipulation and visualization to statistical modeling and reproducible workflows.

My goal is to master R by gradually building hands-on experience through small projects, code snippets, and notes.

Topics I’m Exploring

Data wrangling with dplyr and tidyr
Data visualization with ggplot2
Working with dates and times (lubridate)
Reading and writing data (readr, readxl)
Basic statistics and modeling
Creating R Markdown reports
GitHub integration with RStudio
